            Hyderabad FC (HFC) came back from a goal down to beat SC East Bengal
            (SCEB) 3-2 in the Indian Super League (ISL) at the Tilak Miadan on
            Tuesday.</b
          >
          <p>
            1) 'Roca's rookies' can play In five matches so far, Hyderabad is
            yet to have its full set of overseas players in its starting XI. In
            the draw against ATK Mohun Bagan, it had just two fit foreigners,
            and three in the win over East Bengal. Hyderabad has maintained its
            unbeaten run thanks in large parts to the performances of their
            youngsters. Full-backs Akash Mishra (19) and Asish Rai (21), forward
            Liston Colaco (22), and midfielders Hitesh Sharma (22) and Mohammed
            Yasir (22) have formed the core of this side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manuel Marquez Roca has put his trust in the youngsters and has
            played a significant role in developing these youngsters. Speaking
            about their progress in the build-up to the match, Roca said, "I
            wouldn't say I am impressed [with their performances]. I said
            previously to the media that I am not impressed because I have seen
            them in the training session everyday. I am very, happy for them
            because they are showing big personalities in the game. not only the
            younger players, I don't want to speak about one player but
            Halicharan Narzary is improving every game."

            East Bengal's Robbie Fowler</b
          >
          <p>
            Hyderabad had control of the game despite being a goal down before
            Roca brought on Liston in the second half to add more attacking
            verve to his side. Liston's best have come through substitute
            performances (vs Odisha and East Bengal), when the wiry dribbler has
            taken on some tired defenders
          </p>
          <p>
            On Tuesday, Liston played a part in all three goals, when he won the
            free-kick for the first before he set up the second (Santana) and
            third (Narzary). Explaining the decision to bring him on at the
            start of the second half, Roca said, "I know that he is a very
            important player for us. But you know how injuries are. We have to
            be careful with the injuries because we have only three foreigners.
            Liston is very important but maybe he is at his best when the other
            team is tired. I think he is very powerful.

            >Hyderabad FC head coach Thangboi Singto was pleased with his team’s
            performance as they held Mumbai City FC to a 1-1 draw in the Indian
            Super League (ISL) at the Mumbai Football Arena in Mumbai on
            Saturday.</b
          >
          <p>
            Mumbai City FC managed to take the lead in the 76th minute through a
            Manoj Mohammad own goal. However, Hyderabad FC salvaged a draw
            during injury time thanks to an own goal from Tiri, breaking their
            losing streak. This draw marked Hyderabad FC's first points of the
            season, providing a much-needed boost to the team's morale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Singto expressed his satisfaction with his team's performance,
            despite the fact that they were playing against Mumbai City FC who
            were down to 10 men. Singto stressed the significance of hard work
            his team put in and how it paid off, securing a valuable point in
            this match.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Well in football, for the fans and for the public, and football
            lovers, it's (would have been) said, (we should have got a victory)
            playing against ten men. You know why? But we've seen umpteen times
            that playing men against ten is not easy at all. And with a team
            like Mumbai City FC, former (League Shield) champions and with
            players all around with technical abilities, it was going to be
            tough. Well, today I think it would have been heartbreaking if we
            didn't garner a point at least because it would have been a fourth
            loss. But big, big cheers and credit to the players. They dug in,
            they stuck in, they kept on going and going. We were telling the
            boys that hard work pays off. And today that made the difference,"
            he stated in the post-match press conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hyderabad FC had suffered defeats in all of their first three
            matches, and notably, these losses were all closely contested, with
            Singto's side falling short by just a single goal in each game.
            Prior to their game against Mumbai City FC, their most recent goal
            was scored in the opening match against East Bengal FC. While
            addressing their difficulties in front of goal, Singto remained
            optimistic that his team will improve as the season unfolds.

          <p>
            The strongest comeback often comes when one has their back against
            the wall, and Hyderabad FC will harbour similar hopes when they take
            on Mumbai City FC in the latter’s home turf in their Indian Super
            League (ISL) 2023-24 fixture on Saturday.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hyderabad FC have missed out on positive results by slim margins
            this season and three straight losses have put them on the back
            foot. This away game against the Islanders could spur them on, given
            their impressive head-to-head record against the home side, from
            which their head coach Thangboi Singto is definitely taking
            confidence. Mumbai City FC have beaten them only twice in eight
            face-offs, with four matches ending in a draw and a couple of them
            in Hyderabad FC’s favour.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Islanders, a good start in the ISL has coincided with
            undesirable results in the mid-week Champions League matches. They
            have not dropped points so far in the season and will look to pick
            up all 3 points and go top of the table, where they spent most of
            last season.
